Below ones should not be undo-logged

1. The variable which always only becomes the same constant
2. Pointer that only holds the same address throughout the program
3. write which is guaranteed to not have preceding read of the same address (end_run() is the divider) (Not Implemented)
4. tight loops backup in their checkpoint (unconditionally) and have guard in preheader
4-1. For this to really pay off, we might need unrolling (Not Implemented)
5. when basicblock is write dominated, do backup only when not checkpointing (Not Implemented)
